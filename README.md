## Javascript and DOM Manipulation

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the US eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

I have created a dynamic table based on the dataset that can be searched based on 4 key criteria related to the sightings:

Date of the sightings
City of sightings
State of sightings
Shape of ‘event’

## Technologies
1. JavaScript
2. HTLM
3. CSS
4. D3.js


First, I reviewed the dataset (array of objects) which includes detailed accounts of alien sightings. Each object represents a specific sighting and includes data pertaining to the time, location, shape of event, duration of event, and comments given by the observer.

I compiled the data in a table dinamic table using triggering an Event (Click), forEach, and a series of If Statements.
